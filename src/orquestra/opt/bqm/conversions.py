    Note:
        The convention commonly used in quantum computing is that 0 in a bitstring
        represents eigenvalue 1 of an Ising Hamiltonian,and 1 represents eigenvalue -1.
        However, there is another convention, used in dimod, where the mapping is
        0 -> -1 and 1 -> 1 instead. Therefore if we try to use the bitstrings coming
        from solving the problem framed in one convention to evaluate energy for
        problem state in the second one, the results will be incorrect. This can be
        fixed with changing the value of `change_bitstring_convention` flag. Currently
        we changed the conventions appropriately in `convert_qubo_to_openfermion_ising`
        and `convert_openfermion_ising_to_qubo`, however, this still might be an issue
        in cases where qubo/Ising representation is created using different tools.

        shows that it needs to be handled with caution.
